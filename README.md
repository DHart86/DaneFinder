DANE FINDER


Dane Finder is a jQuery powered web application that queries the Petfinder API to return pet and shelter results given a zip code and distance radius. You can also filter 
by gender and age. I chose to display one pet at a time, to a) give each dog their time to shine, and b) I wanted to play around with jQuery Mobile's swipe feature to fetch
new pets!

In addition to the core feature of the app, at the bottom there are a couple additional resources, all utilizing a different method. From a simple new tab opening google search, to a an Amazon affiliate monetization div being unhidden, to an entirely different query to Google Places retrieving dog grooming (only those with a rating) for the given zip code, and finally an iframe opening in the middle of the page directed to the ASPCA donation page.
